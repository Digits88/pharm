= Pharm

The little engine that could.

= Installation

This is a fully-formed Rails application. Thus you must know how to install Rails applications on your host.  Update the following files appropriately:

environment.rb:

  ExceptionNotifier.sender_address       = %("Pharm bug" <info@iridesco.com>)
  ExceptionNotifier.exception_recipients = %w(shawn@iridesco.com barry@iridesco.com)

= Dreamhost Installation

* start a domain (or fully hosted subdomain) current/public
* create MySQL DB
  - pharm_production
* setup deploy.rb
* cold deploy
* shared area yml file setup (cap task at least for admin?) (remember host name in database.yml)
* shared area uploads directory
* full deploy with migrations

(Can we make a simple drag and drop FTP deploy?)
