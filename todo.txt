o Page caching
  x Stale checks
  x Photo show screens
  x Decache when photo updated
  x Decache all when settings updated
  - Creating photo, decache previous photo so next button works
  - Creating photo, decache first-ever photo so circular rotation on photo click works
  - Decache all upon deploy?
  - It looks to me like we're not seeing client-side caching of photo assets. WTF?
o Pretty ID's in URL
o Increase amount of photo body showing in the admin index screen
o About link. AJAX and display text.
o Move bugmail settings to admin.yml file.
o RSS feeds
o API?
o Paging on /admin screen.
o Consider how to make this more easily deployable.
o Timezone aware front-end and backend.
o Look through additions - what should go to Template?
